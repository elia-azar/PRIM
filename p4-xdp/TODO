[ERROR] Docker/Vagrant does not work
-> Can't play with vagrant because VT-x is disabled in the BIOS for all CPU modes.

# sudo kvm-ok
INFO: /dev/kvm does not exist
HINT:   sudo modprobe kvm_intel
INFO: Your CPU supports KVM extensions
INFO: KVM (vmx) is disabled by your BIOS
HINT: Enter your BIOS setup and enable Virtualization Technology (VT),
      and then hard poweroff/poweron your system
KVM acceleration can NOT be used

# sudo modprobe kvm_intel
modprobe: ERROR: could not insert 'kvm_intel': Operation not supported

In order to it, we should enable VT in kernel, and we can't do it without changing BIOS manually when booting

[BUG] P4-16 Compiler

# make check-xdp
12% tests passed, 15 tests failed out of 17
Only xdp7 and xdp12 passed the test

[BUG-FIX] Modified the Makefile inside tests/ and was able to compile all the p4 codes to obj files
except for xdp7 and xdp12 due to limitation problems.
-> error: xdp12.c:0:0: in function ebpf_filter i32 (%struct.xdp_md*): 
Looks like the BPF stack limit of 512 bytes is exceeded. 
Please move large on stack variables into BPF per-cpu array map.



[DONE] Create P4 filter code
[DONE] Compile the P4 code to obj file
[DONE] Load it on a device

[TODO] Check how to access values inside hash map
