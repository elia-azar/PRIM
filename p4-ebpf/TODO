Write p4 prog by starting with headers definition
Then define the parser : ethernet -> ipv4 -> udp
Create match-action table to match specific port 320 (actions: drop or save)
See how to save packets in pcap file with p4 -> maybe do DMA if possible

Once done, see if I can compile it with p4c-ebpf and load it in the kernel
